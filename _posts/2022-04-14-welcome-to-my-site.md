It's been a long time since I've maintained a blog, and I wanted to start one again.  I find blogging about things I find interesting to be helpful, specifically when it's something challenging, like security concepts, tools, exploits, etc. 

My hope is that I can share some of my experiences with the greater security community, and hopefully with a focus on defense.  While it's gotten better in recent years, I feel like blue-teaming just isn't as sexy as red-teaming, and doesn't get the attention that it _needs_.

If you're seeing this, thanks for reading!  If It's been more than a week or two since I posted this initial post, please do drop me a line: keep me honest!
