To OWASP leadership,

I’m writing this publicly and transparently because I believe that is the spirit in which OWASP itself was founded.

Recently, project leaders were asked to provide feedback on the new website redesign through a private monday.com form, with no public discussion, no shared visibility into submitted feedback, and no follow-up conversation. Attempts to discuss concerns openly in email or through Slack were redirected back to the form.

Respectfully: this approach feels at odds with the very first word in **Open Web Application Security Project**.

OWASP’s strength has never come from forms or funnels.  
It has always come from open collaboration, public discussion, and community ownership.

Right now, many of us who maintain projects feel eager to help — but unable to engage.

## Why this matters

OWASP is successful and respected because of its community:

- Volunteer project leaders
- Maintainers
- Contributors
- Documentation writers
- Tool builders
- Educators

The organization’s credibility and influence come directly from this work.

When those same people are asked for feedback but given no venue for open dialogue or transparency, it sends an unintended message:

> “We want your input, but not your participation.”

That is not how open communities thrive.

Open communities discuss in the open.  
They collaborate in the open.  
They disagree in the open.  
They iterate in the open.

## A broader concern: fundraising vs. support

I also want to speak candidly about something that feels uncomfortable but important.

There is a strong emphasis on donation calls-to-action across the site.  This is extremely clear when clicking the "Projects" nav link:
- The first thing visible above the fold is a donation call-to-action rather than any actual projects.
- The button says “contribute to projects,” but links to donating money. Contribution means much more than money (code, docs, testing, advocacy).
- Viewing all projects is buried behind 3-4 clicks instead of being prominently featured
- This feels misaligned with how OWASP became successful - projects should come first, fundraising second.

These aren’t just polish issues — they impact discoverability of the very projects that make OWASP valuable.  Please remember that many project leaders:
- self-host demos
- pay for infrastructure out of pocket
- receive minimal operational support

Speaking personally: I pay monthly hosting costs for a small OWASP project demo that OWASP has declined to cover.

If OWASP is investing heavily in fundraising, it’s reasonable for project maintainers to ask:

**How is that money supporting the projects that create OWASP’s value?**

Featuring projects and empowering maintainers should come before donation asks.  I understand the need to fundraise - our OWASP GitHub repositories already have funding.yaml pointed to OWASP.  This just feels like a step too far.

Projects are the reason people donate, not the other way around.

## Concrete Recommendations

Constructively, here’s what I believe would help:

- Public discussion channels for website feedback (GitHub issues, discussions, Slack threads, etc.)
  - There is a Slack channel for the website redesign, but there is no engagement and feedback is being redirected to the aforementioned form
- Transparent tracking of reported issues and decisions
- Community working groups for major initiatives like the website
- Prioritizing project discoverability over fundraising CTAs
- Clear reinvestment of funds into project infrastructure/support

None of this requires more volunteers — we’re already here and willing, even with a tight and unplanned deadline like we were given in this particular case.

We just need to be invited into the process.

## Closing

This letter is written from a place of caring, not just frustration. 

I contribute to OWASP because I believe in what it stands for:
open knowledge, open collaboration, and community ownership of security.

If we lose openness in how we work together, we risk losing what makes OWASP special.

I hope we can return to a more transparent, collaborative approach, and I’m happy to help however I can. This is not a "rage-quit" letter, but instead a plea to OWASP's leadership to stay grounded in one of the core principles of OWASP - **openness**. 

I fully plan to continue contributing to OWASP, and while this feedback may be critical, I would still suggest others become involved with OWASP if they are looking to contribute!  If you are considering contributing, check out one of the [hundreds of OWASP Projects](https://owasp.org/projects/)

Respectfully,

Leo Reading
