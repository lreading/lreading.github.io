<h4>Recovering developer turned security engineer.</h4>


<p>
I’ve worn a lot of hats across engineering — from writing code and wrangling servers to debugging production issues, dabbling in DevOps, and eventually falling in love with security. I’m currently a maintainer of <a href="https://www.github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OWASP Threat Dragon</a> and creator of <a href="https://www.github.com/lreading/garak-repo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garak-Repo</a>.

When I’m not chasing vulnerabilities, you’ll find me on a four-wheeler or side-by-side, somewhere in the woods.
