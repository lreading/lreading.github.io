To OWASP leadership,

I’m writing this publicly and transparently because I believe that is the spirit in which OWASP itself was founded.

Recently, project leaders were asked to provide feedback on the new website redesign through a private monday.com form, with no public discussion, no shared visibility into submitted feedback, and no follow-up conversation. Attempts to discuss concerns openly via email or Slack were redirected back to that same form.

Respectfully, this approach feels at odds with the very first word in **Open Worldwide Application Security Project**.

OWASP’s strength has never come from forms or funnels.  
It has always come from open collaboration, public discussion, and community ownership.

Right now, many of us who maintain projects feel eager to help, but were not given the opportunity to _meaningfully_ engage.

## Why this matters

OWASP is successful and respected because of its community:

- Volunteer project leaders  
- Maintainers  
- Contributors  
- Documentation writers  
- Tool builders  
- Educators 
- ...and many more

The organization’s credibility and influence come directly from the work our community provides. Over the past few years, some governance changes, such as removing voting rights for complimentary members, have already left parts of the community feeling less represented. Processes that reduce visibility or participation risk reinforcing that perception.

When those same people are asked for feedback but given no venue for open dialogue or transparency, it sends an unintended message:

> “We want your input, but not your participation.”

That is not how open communities thrive.

Open communities discuss in the open.  
They collaborate in the open.  
They disagree in the open.  
They iterate in the open.

## A broader concern: fundraising vs. support

I also want to speak candidly about something that feels uncomfortable but important.

There is a strong emphasis on donation calls-to-action across the site. This is especially noticeable when clicking the **Projects** navigation link:

- The first thing visible above the fold is a donation call-to-action rather than actual projects  
- The button says “contribute to projects,” but links to a _donation page_, even though "contribution" can mean code, documentation, testing, advocacy, mentorship, or many other things
- Viewing all projects is buried behind several clicks instead of being prominently featured  
- Projects appear secondary to fundraising rather than the primary focus

This risks centering fundraising ahead of the very work that makes OWASP valuable.

These aren’t just polish issues, they directly impact discoverability of the projects that define OWASP.

At the same time, many project leaders:

- self-host demos  
- pay for infrastructure out of pocket  
- receive minimal operational support  

Speaking personally, I pay monthly hosting costs for a small OWASP project demo that OWASP has declined to cover.

If OWASP is investing heavily in fundraising, it’s reasonable for project maintainers to ask:

**How is that money supporting the projects that create OWASP’s value?**

Featuring projects and empowering maintainers should come before donation asks. I fully understand the need to fundraise.  In fact, all of our repositories already point funding back to OWASP.  This new website design just feels misaligned with community priorities.

Projects are the reason people donate, not the other way around.

## Concrete recommendations

Constructively, here’s what I believe would help:

- Public discussion channels for website feedback (GitHub issues, discussions, Slack threads, etc.)  
  - A Slack channel exists today, but engagement is minimal and feedback is still redirected to the private form  
- Transparent tracking of reported issues and decisions  
- Community working groups for major initiatives like the website  
- Prioritizing project discoverability over fundraising CTAs  
- Clear reinvestment of funds into project infrastructure and maintainer support  

None of this requires more volunteers. We’re already here and willing, even when timelines are tight and unplanned.

We just need to be invited into the process.

## Closing

This letter comes from a place of care, not anger.

I contribute to OWASP because I believe in what it stands for: open knowledge, open collaboration, and community ownership of security.

If we lose openness in how we work together, we risk losing what makes OWASP special.

I hope we can return to a more transparent, collaborative approach, and I’m happy to help however I can. This is not a “rage-quit” letter: it’s a sincere request for OWASP leadership to stay grounded in one of its core principles: **openness**.

I fully plan to continue contributing, and despite this criticism, I would still encourage others to get involved. OWASP remains an incredible community doing important work.

If you’re considering contributing, check out one of the [hundreds of OWASP projects](https://owasp.org/projects/). Our community appreciates the help!

Respectfully,

Leo Reading
