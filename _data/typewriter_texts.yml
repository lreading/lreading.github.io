- Defense in depth helps fill the gaps you didn't even know you had.
- When blue-teaming, assume positive intent... Unless I'm around.  I'm definitely up to no good.
- The security team is always the same size as the organization.  We're in this together.
- Short passwords are better... For the attacker.  Keep em long and strong!
- MFA stops a ridiculously high number of credential stuffing attacks.  Use it!
