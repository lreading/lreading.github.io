For as long as I can remember, I've always "Jack of all trades".  My career in technology has been no different.  I spent the first half of my career as a software developer.  I frequently found myself on small teams that needed to do things outside of the typical developer scope, such as system administration, networking, and devops.

After dabbling in site reliability engineering and customer support, I heard about a pen-test that had quite a few findings.  I was always fascinated by being able to use things in unintended ways, and this was my foot in the door to security.  My employer had nobody dedicated to security at the time, and they supported me transitioning into a full-time security role.

I've been fortunate to have worked with fantastic people throughout my career, and with organizations who gave me the opportunity to amass an enormous amount of experience. Most recently, I've become interested in contributing to open source work, and being a security evangalist.

I've found that wearing my blue-hat allows me more opportunity to flex my programming muscles.  Offensive work is sexy and tactics are frequently discussed. As a community, we aren't <em>quite</em> there with defense yet, and I'm hoping to use this space to contribute more to that end.
